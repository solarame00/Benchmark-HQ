## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of trust and reliability in data.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), almost white, to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), approximately 30 degrees from blue, to highlight important actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable design.
- Use minimalistic and clear icons for navigation and data representation, focusing on understandability.
- Design a clean dashboard layout with a left-side navigation bar for 'All Benchmarks,' 'Add New,' 'Compare,' and 'Stats'. Use a table view that enables clickable rows that open to display the full benchmark details.
- Employ subtle animations to enhance user experience, such as transitions when expanding details or updating data.
